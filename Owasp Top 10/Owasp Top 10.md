# OWASP TOP 10 

OWASP stands for the Open Web Application Security Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the security of web applications. Every year, the organization publishes a list of the top 10 most common web application security vulnerabilities, known as the OWASP Top 10. The list is intended to help developers, security professionals, and organizations understand the most significant risks to web application security and take steps to mitigate those risks.

1. ### Injection: 
Injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to insert malicious code into a web application by manipulating input fields or parameters. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive data stored in the application's database.

2. ### Broken Authentication and Session Management: 
Web applications often use authentication and session management to control access to sensitive resources. If these mechanisms are flawed, an attacker may be able to gain unauthorized access to the application or impersonate legitimate users.

3. ### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): 
XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious code into a web page, which is then executed by the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, or to take control of the victim's browser.

4. ### Insecure Direct Object References: 
 Direct object references occur when a web application directly references an internal object, such as a file or database record, using a user-supplied parameter. If the application does not properly validate these parameters, an attacker may be able to access unauthorized resources.

5. ### Security Misconfiguration: 
Security misconfiguration refers to flaws in the way a web application is configured, such as default accounts with easily guessable passwords, or publicly accessible error messages. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to the application or its underlying systems.

6. ### Sensitive Data Exposure: 
Sensitive data exposure occurs when a web application stores or transmits sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data, in an insecure manner. This can allow attackers to steal or manipulate this information.

7. ### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): 
CSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate a victim's web browser into making unauthorized requests to a web application on the attacker's behalf. This can allow the attacker to perform actions within the application as if they were the victim.

8. ### Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: 
Web applications often use third-party components, such as libraries or frameworks, to provide certain functionality. If these components have known vulnerabilities, an attacker may be able to exploit them to compromise the application.

9. ### Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: 
Proper logging and monitoring is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents. If an application does not have sufficient logging and monitoring in place, it may be more difficult to detect and respond to attacks.

10. ### Failure to Restrict URL Access: 
Web applications often use access controls to restrict access to certain resources or functionality. If these controls are not properly implemented, an attacker may be able to access unauthorized resources or perform unauthorized actions.

Understanding and addressing these top 10 vulnerabilities is essential for building secure web applications. By following best practices for web application development and regularly testing and updating applications, organizations can protect their systems and data from potential attacks.
