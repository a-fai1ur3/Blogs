9. ### Insufficient logging and monitoring
Insufficient logging and monitoring occurs when an organization does not have proper logging and monitoring in place to detect and respond to security threats. This can make it difficult to identify and mitigate attacks, and can lead to significant data breaches or other security incidents. To prevent this, it is important to implement proper logging and monitoring measures, such as intrusion detection systems and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and to regularly review and analyze log data.

10. ### Failure to restrict URL access
Failure to restrict URL access occurs when an application fails to properly restrict access to certain URLs or areas of the application. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data or to perform unauthorized actions. To prevent this, it is important to implement proper access controls and to ensure that only authorized users are able to access sensitive areas of the application.

11. ### Insufficient transport layer protection
Insufficient transport layer protection refers to the lack of proper protection for data as it is transmitted across networks. This can include the lack of encryption for sensitive data or the use of weak encryption algorithms. To prevent this, it is important to use strong encryption algorithms and to properly secure the transmission of sensitive data.

12. ### Unvalidated input
Unvalidated input occurs when an application fails to properly validate user input before it is processed. This can allow attackers to inject malicious input, such as SQL commands or malicious code, which can be executed by the application. To prevent unvalidated input, it is important to properly validate all user input and to sanitize it as necessary.

13. ### Using components with insufficiently secure defaults
Using components with insufficiently secure defaults refers to the use of third-party libraries or frameworks that have insecure default configurations. This can make it easy for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to a system. To prevent this, it is important to properly configure components and to ensure that they are configured with secure default settings.

14. ### Insufficient cryptography
Insufficient cryptography occurs when an organization does not properly use encryption to protect sensitive data. This can include the use of weak encryption algorithms, the lack of proper key management, or the use of insecure protocols. To prevent insufficient cryptography, it is important to use strong encryption algorithms and to properly implement and manage cryptographic keys.

15. ### Cross-platform issues
Cross-platform issues refer to vulnerabilities that are specific to applications that are designed to run on multiple platforms, such as web applications that are accessed from different browsers or operating systems. These vulnerabilities can occur when an application is not properly designed to handle the differences between platforms, leading to security weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent cross-platform issues, it is important to properly design applications to be platform-agnostic and to properly test them on all relevant platforms.

16. ### Improper error handling
Improper error handling occurs when an application fails to properly handle and log errors, leading to the exposure of sensitive information or the execution of malicious input. To prevent improper error handling, it is important to properly handle and log errors and to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed.

17. ### Lack of security controls in custom code
The lack of security controls in custom code refers to the lack of proper security measures in custom code developed in-house. This can include the lack of proper input validation, the lack of proper access controls, and the lack of proper error handling. To prevent this, it is important to follow secure coding

18. ### Lack of proper testing during development
Lack of proper testing during development refers to the failure to properly test applications for security vulnerabilities before they are deployed. This can lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent this, it is important to implement a robust testing process during development, including both manual and automated testing, to ensure that applications are secure before they are deployed.
