# SANS Top 25 Weakness

The SANS Top 25 is a list of the most critical security weaknesses that organizations should address in order to protect themselves from cyber threats. The list is compiled by the SANS Institute, a leading cybersecurity education and research organization. The Top 25 weaknesses are based on the frequency and impact of the vulnerabilities, as well as the ease with which they can be exploited by attackers.

### The SANS Top 25 includes the following weaknesses:

1. Injection
2. Broken authentication and session management
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
4. Insecure direct object references
5. Security misconfiguration
6. Sensitive data discovery
7. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
8. Using components with known vulnerabilities
9. Insufficient logging and monitoring
10. Failure to restrict URL access
11. Insufficient transport layer protection
12. Unvalidated input
13. Using components with insufficiently secure defaults
14. Insufficient cryptography
15. Cross-platform issues
16. Improper error handling
17. Lack of security controls in custom code
18. Lack of proper testing during development
19. Insufficient protection against malicious code
20. Inadequate security controls in third-party libraries
21. Insufficient authentication controls
22. Lack of secure coding practices
23. Lack of security controls in mobile code
24. Lack of security controls in cloud environments
25. Lack of security controls in Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    
By addressing these weaknesses, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of cyber attacks and protect their sensitive data and systems from being compromised.
