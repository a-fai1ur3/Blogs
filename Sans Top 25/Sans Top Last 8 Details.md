19. ### Insufficient protection against malicious code
Insufficient protection against malicious code refers to the lack of proper measures to prevent the execution of malicious code on a system. This can include the lack of proper antivirus software or the lack of proper access controls to prevent the execution of malicious code. To prevent this, it is important to implement proper protective measures, such as antivirus software and access controls, to prevent the execution of malicious code on a system.

20. ### Inadequate security controls in third-party libraries
Inadequate security controls in third-party libraries refer to the lack of proper security measures in third-party libraries or frameworks that are used in an application. This can include the use of libraries with known vulnerabilities or the lack of proper security controls in the code of the library. To prevent this, it is important to properly research and evaluate third-party libraries before using them and to ensure that they are properly secured.

21. ### Insufficient authentication controls
Insufficient authentication controls refer to the lack of proper measures to verify the identity of users or systems. This can include the use of weak passwords or the lack of proper multi-factor authentication. To prevent this, it is important to implement strong authentication measures, such as strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, to properly verify the identity of users and systems.

22. ### Lack of secure coding practices
Lack of secure coding practices refers to the failure to follow best practices for secure coding when developing applications. This can include the lack of proper input validation, the use of insecure coding practices, or the lack of proper error handling. To prevent this, it is important to follow best practices for secure coding and to properly train developers on how to write secure code.

23. ### Lack of security controls in mobile code
Lack of security controls in mobile code refers to the lack of proper security measures in mobile applications. This can include the lack of proper access controls, the lack of proper input validation, or the lack of proper protection for sensitive data. To prevent this, it is important to implement proper security controls in mobile applications and to properly test them for vulnerabilities.

24. ### Lack of security controls in cloud environments
Lack of security controls in cloud environments refers to the lack of proper security measures in cloud-based systems. This can include the lack of proper access controls, the lack of proper encryption for sensitive data, or the lack of proper security controls for cloud-based infrastructure. To prevent this, it is important to implement proper security controls in cloud environments and to follow best practices for securing cloud-based systems.

25. ### Lack of security controls in Internet of Things (IoT) devices
Lack of security controls in Internet of Things (IoT) devices refers to the lack of proper security measures in IoT devices, such as smart thermostats, security cameras, or smart appliances. This can include the lack of proper access controls, the lack of proper encryption for sensitive data, or the lack of proper security controls for IoT infrastructure. To prevent this, it is important to implement proper security controls in IoT devices and to follow best practices for securing IoT systems.

By addressing these weaknesses, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of cyber attacks and protect their sensitive data and systems from being compromised. It is important to regularly review and
